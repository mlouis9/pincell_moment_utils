    "## Introduction\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to explore the dependence of simulation data on the number of independent samples used for the transport calculation. The motivation for this is to determine if it's feasible to decrease the number of samples that are needed for each incident flux calcualtion, which can become the dominant computational cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is reasonable to think that, even if the total number of samples isn't equal to the number of neutron histories in the OpenMC input, since every source particle's trajectory is randomly determined by interaction probabilities, the outgoing flux may still have good statistical properties even if the source particles aren't strictly sampled randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "To facilitate this, a pincell simulation with $10^7$ neutron histories ($10^5$ particles per batch and 100 batches) was run with different source files with $10^5,10^6,$ and $10^7$ independent samples"
